# Sports Roster Project

## Description 

The following application is the sports roster for a team, an authorized user can thereby do all of the normal CRUD functionality we had learned earlier in the class. This task was completed by using Firebase for webhosting of the database for the players on the team, along with the React framework to construct the application itself.

This project expanded upon all the previous knowledge of React components, JSX etc., but really reenforced the use of state and props on different levels of the application. We also learned the value of prop-types in error checking. 

Overall pretty cool app...
